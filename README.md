# ðŸŒ¸ Happy Birthday â€“ A Thoughtful, Dynamic Web Gift

This project is a creative, personalized birthday gift built entirely with HTML, JavaScript, and the Bootstrap framework. Itâ€™s designed to create a simple yet impactful digital experienceâ€”pressing a button triggers a bouquet of flowers to bloom dynamically on the screen, accompanied by a kind, rotating message. As well the website has typing sound affects when rendering text, so be sure to use it with the volume on! :)

The design is mobile-first, ensuring that the experience feels intuitive and visually clean on phones, while also scaling smoothly across tablets and desktops. Thanks to Bootstrapâ€™s responsive grid system and modern layout tools, the layout automatically adjusts to different screen sizes without compromising the aesthetic.

ðŸ’¡ Key Features:
- Mobile-First UI: Designed with phones in mind first, but scales beautifully to larger screens.

- Dynamic Image Rendering: Flower images are loaded and animated dynamically every time you press the button, making the experience feel fresh and alive.

- Responsive Layout: Using Bootstrap's layout classes, the page stays centered and beautiful across all devices.

- Randomized Messages: Short, encouraging notes appear with every bouquet, reinforcing the thoughtful intent behind the design.

- Lightweight and Accessible: No backend neededâ€”this runs entirely in the browser using client-side JS.
